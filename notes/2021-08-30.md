## Recall Relational

Now, lets review some relational ideas and some SQL

Crate the schema for our table

    create table countries (
        country_code char(2) primary key,
        country_name text unique
    );

Next populate some data

    insert into countries (country_code, country_name) values
        ('us', 'United States'),
        ('mx', 'Mexico'),
        ('au', 'Australia'),
        ('gb', 'United Kingdom'),
        ('de', 'Germany'),
        ('ll', 'Loompland');


So, this workflow is not good.  Let's [improve](../env/README.md)

Okay, let's get back to SQL!


Validate that the constraint is observed

    insert into countries values ('uk', 'United Kingdom');

Display all entries in table

    select * from countries;

Delete Loompland, it is not real

    delete from countries where country_code = 'll';

OR

    delete from countries where country_name = 'Loompland';

Which is better and why?

Create cities w/ foreign key constraint to county

    create table cities (
        name text not null,
        postal_code varchar(9) check (postal_code <> ''),
        country_code char(2) references countries,
        primary key (country_code, postal_code)
    );

Try to crate a city that does not conform to the foreign key constraint

    insert into cities values ('Toronto', 'M4C1B5', 'ca');

Try a valid insert

    insert into cities values ('Portland', '87200', 'us');

The postal code was wrong, update it:

    -- NOTE that I suggest doing the lookup by postal code and not name
    -- (as the book does) since there is no constraint that the name is unique,
    -- if there were other Portlands in the DB, all of their zips would change
    update cities set postal_code = '97206'
    where postal_code = '87200' and name = 'Portland';

Perform a join

    select cities.*, country_name
    from cities inner join countries
        on cities.country_code = countries.country_code;

Create a venue table

    create table venues (
        venue_id serial primary key,
        name varchar(255),
        street_address text,
        type char(7)
            check ( type in ('public', 'private') ) default 'public',
        postal_code varchar(9),
        country_code char(2),
        foreign key (country_code, postal_code)
            references cities (country_code, postal_code) match full
    );

    insert into venues (name, postal_code, country_code) values
        ('Crystal Ballroom', '97206', 'us');

Lets do a join

    select v.venue_id, v.name, c.name
    from venues v inner join cities c
        on v.postal_code = c.postal_code and v.country_code = c.country_code;

Add a famous doghnut shop to demonstate returning values

    insert into venues (name, postal_code, country_code) values
        ('Voodoo Doughnut', '97206', 'us') returning venue_id;

Demonstrate outer joins,
create evens table and add a few events

    create table events (
        event_id serial primary key,
        title text,
        starts timestamp,
        ends timestamp,
        venue_id integer references venues(venue_id)
    );

    insert into events (title, starts, ends, venue_id) values
        ('LARP Club', '2012-02-15 17:30', '2012-02-15 19:30', 2),
        ('April Fools Day', '2012-04-01', '2012-04-01 23:59', null),
        ('Christmas Day', '2012-12-25', '2012-12-25 23:59', null);

    select e.title, v.name
    from events e left join venues v
        on e.venue_id = v.venue_id;

And if we are going to be searching on event titles and times, lets create an
ordered index

    create index events_title
        on events using btree (title);
    create index events_starts
        on events using btree (starts);
