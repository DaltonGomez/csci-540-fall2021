# Presentation

We have spent the semester getting familiar with multiple topics in of
databases. Some topics were practical (e.g., how to use a few non-relational
databases) and some were algorithmic (e.g., probabilistic algos, B-trees) Now,
it is your turn to lead the class and help everyone understand something that
you are interested in.

## Topic Selection

On Mon Nov 1, propose a database related topic that you would like to learn
about and lecture on. I may reach out to discuss your topic further.  I will use
your topic suggestions to organize the lectures following the exam.

## Description

For your topic, you and your partners (partners optional) will lead the lecture.
You will have two steps:

* By at least midnight, TWO days before your lecture, post on slack links
  to resources and a description of what students should do prior to your
  lecture to be prepared. Sources may be materials that you put together,
  papers, video, software to install, problems to work through, message board
  postings, etc.  Note that if you need to post content, for example a PDF, Box
  is a campus supported option for sharing.  Students are expected to come
  prepared to class by working through the material you suggest. Note that you
  should target the student preparation at under an hour, it should NOT exceed
  two hours.

* On the day of your presentation, arrive at least five min early for class to
  be ready to start on time. You may use between 30-45 min of the lecture
  period. We will use the last five min to fill out [feed back
  forms](./feedback.pdf).
  Feel free to get creative. Your lecture may be interactive, you can have
  people work on problems, write code, discuss in groups, or anything else that
  you think may help you to introduce the class to your topic.

* By midnight at most TWO days after your lecture, a (approximately) two page
  written summary of your lecture (either Markdown or PDF) that will be posted
  on the course website

* By midnight at most TWO days after your lecture, a (approximately) one
  paragraph to one page written reflection from the peer feedback and how you
  would incorporate that feedback next time you lecture.  This will NOT be
  posted on the course website

  You will be
  graded on the following:

  As a lecturer:

    - Pre-lecture materials (10 points)
    - Demonstration of knowledge of the presented material (30 points)
    - Preparation of the lecture (20 points)
    - Effectiveness of the lecture (10 points)
    - Lecture summary (15 points)
    - Peer feedback reflection (05 points)

  As a learner:

    - Your participation (10 points)
